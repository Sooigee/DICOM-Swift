//  DicomTransportOpenFailureTests.swift

//
//  Issue #1696: `open()` waited out its whole timeout for a peer that had
//  already refused it, then blamed TCP.
//
//  `NWConnection` does not move to `.failed` when it thinks the situation could
//  improve on its own. It stops at `.waiting`, holding the reason. A refused
//  port lands there in milliseconds; so does a rejected certificate. The state
//  handler treated everything but `.ready`/`.failed` as nothing worth waking up
//  for, so the caller sat until the deadline and was then told the connection
//  timed out — the one explanation that was not true.
//
//  These measure the clock, not only the error. An assertion on the error alone
//  would still pass against the version that took a minute to produce it.
