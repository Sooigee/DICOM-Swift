//  Monotonic, nanosecond-resolution timing source for the benchmark suite.
//
//  CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() is unsuitable for sub-microsecond work: it returns
//  seconds since 2001 as a Double, and at the current epoch offset (~7.9e8 s) one
//  ulp is 2^-23 s ≈ 119 ns. Anything faster than that rounds to exactly 0.0 no
//  matter how precise the underlying clock is. It is also wall-clock based, so a
//  clock adjustment mid-run can produce a negative interval.
//
//  DispatchTime reads the mach timebase and keeps the value in integer
//  nanoseconds, so it is both monotonic and free of that precision floor.
//
//  Created by automated performance benchmarking suite.
